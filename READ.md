# 03 JavaScript: Employee Payroll Tracker

## Task

This week's Challenge requires you to modify starter code to create an application that enables a payroll manager to view and manage employee payroll data. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story

```md
AS A payroll manager
I WANT AN employee payroll tracker
SO THAT I can see my employees' payroll data and properly budget for the company
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN an employee payroll tracker
WHEN I click the "Add employee" button
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts asking for first name, last name, and salary
WHEN I finish adding an employee
THEN I am prompted to continue or cancel
WHEN I choose to continue
THEN I am prompted to add a new employee
WHEN I choose to cancel
THEN my employee data is displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console shows computed and aggregated data
```

## Overview
The task request is to create a new employee payroll tracker that will prompt the user to enter employee information and then return the employee information alphabetically. To begin, a function was needed to prompt the user for input and utilize a while loop to ask for more employees. Next, a function was needed to display the employee average salary in the console. Finally, a function was needed to select a random employee from the employee array to log in the console.
